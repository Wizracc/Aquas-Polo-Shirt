Aqua's Polo Shirt was a project for Aqua Dragon's discord server. The objective of the bot was to count recent emoji usage, and later gained the functionality of purging underused emojis. As the discord API updated and changed things around, a bit of instability was introduced in the bot, and it stopped functioning reliably. The bot is intended to be rewritten soon, probably in node.js.
